## Missing Number Algorithm
Given an array of numbers 0-n, find the missing number in the array.

If there is no missing number, return the next number in the sequence

Assume all arrays have a length of 1

### Test Cases

[0, 1, 3, 4] - 2

[9, 8, 3, 6, 5, 0, 4, 2, 1] - 7

[1] - 0

[4, 3, 1, 0, 5, 2] - 6
